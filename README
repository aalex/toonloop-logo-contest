Toonloop logo
-------------

The toonloop.svg file can be open with inkscape. 

Next, a PNG can be created from it with the following command:

 $ inkscape -f toonloop.svg -w 48 -h 48 -e toonloop.png

Install it to /usr/local/share/pixmap so that it is Toonloop's logo. This way, 
one can see how it looks in the gnome panel or so, on a black, grey or white 
background, for example. 

The logo needs to have at least two colors in it. Black and white or grey are fine, fine other colors are fine too.

It has been created from a frame in the famous horse in motion set of photographies by Eadweard Muybridge. I think it is the second in the third row of http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Muybridge_race_horse_gallop.jpg


Other sizes
-----------

We also need to create a 32x32 image in the XPM format. (I think it's for the Debian menu) That means the logo needs to look good in 48x48 and 32x32. This is quite small!
